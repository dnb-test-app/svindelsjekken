üîç TWO-PHASE DOMAIN VERIFICATION STRATEGY üîç

## PHASE 1: VERIFY LEGITIMACY (Search for positive evidence FIRST)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT jump to fraud searches first! Start by looking for legitimate company information.

FOR ANY DOMAIN/URL:
1. **Company/Brand Search**:
   - Search: "[company name] Wikipedia" (established companies have Wikipedia pages)
   - Search: "[company name] official website"
   - Search: "[company name] LinkedIn company" (legitimate businesses have LinkedIn)
   - Search: "[domain] about us OR company information"
   - Search: "site:[domain] about OR contact" (check if site has company info)

2. **Business Registry Search**:
   - Norwegian: "[company] site:brreg.no" (Br√∏nn√∏ysundregistrene)
   - Swedish: "[company] bolagsverket" or "[company] allabolag.se"
   - Danish: "[company] cvr.dk"
   - International: "[company] [country] business registry"

3. **Reputation & Reviews** (for e-commerce):
   - Search: "[store name] trustpilot reviews"
   - Search: "[store name] customer reviews"
   - Search: "[store name] anmeldelse OR erfaring"

## PHASE 2: CHECK FOR FRAUD (Only after Phase 1)

After gathering positive information, NOW search for fraud reports:

1. **Norwegian Fraud Databases**:
   - Search: "[domain] site:forbrukertilsynet.no"
   - Search: "[domain] site:forbrukerradet.no"
   - Search: "[domain] site:svindel.no"
   - Search: "[domain] site:nettvett.no"

2. **General Fraud Search**:
   - Search: "[domain] scam OR fraud OR svindel"
   - Search: "[domain] falsk nettbutikk" (fake online store)
   - Search: "[store name] returns china" (common scam indicator for fashion)

3. **Police & Authority Warnings**:
   - Search: "site:politiet.no [domain] svindel"
   - Search: "[domain] phishing warning"

## üìä STATUS DECISION LOGIC üìä

Use this EXACT logic to determine status:

### ‚úÖ status="legitimate" WHEN:
‚úì Found positive evidence (Wikipedia OR official company info OR business registry)
‚úì Established business with clear history (founding year, known brand)
‚úì Social media presence (LinkedIn, official Instagram/Facebook)
‚úì NO fraud reports or warnings found

**Examples of LEGITIMATE:**
- holzweileroslo.com: "Established Norwegian fashion brand since 2012, Wikipedia page, sold in 180+ stores, official website verified"
- voyado.com: "Swedish B2B SaaS company, customer experience platform for retail, 400+ clients, Wikipedia and LinkedIn verified"
- nrk.no: "Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, official national broadcaster, government-owned"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è status="unknown" WHEN:
? No sufficient company information found (no Wikipedia, no clear about page, no business registry)
? Domain exists but appears to be new or genuinely obscure
? Cannot verify if legitimate OR fraudulent with available information

**Examples of UNKNOWN:**
- brandnewstore2024.com: "Recently registered domain, no Wikipedia, no business registry, no company information available, no fraud reports - insufficient information"
- generic-shop.online: "New domain, minimal website content, no established presence, cannot verify legitimacy"

### ‚ùå status="verified_scam" WHEN:
‚úó Found fraud warnings from authorities (forbrukertilsynet.no, politiet.no)
‚úó Multiple scam reports from users
‚úó Confirmed phishing or fake store database entries
‚úó Known scam patterns (typosquatting, suspicious TLD with no legitimate business)

**Examples of VERIFIED_SCAM:**
- modeshoposlo.com: "Confirmed fake fashion store, warnings on forbrukertilsynet.no, multiple user scam reports, ships from China despite claiming to be Norwegian"
- dnb-verify.tk: "Phishing domain impersonating DNB bank, suspicious .tk TLD, no legitimate business information"

## üåç INTERNATIONAL DOMAINS SPECIAL HANDLING üåç

For .com, .se, .dk, .eu, etc. (non-.no domains):

**DO NOT expect Norwegian fraud database hits!**
- International legitimate companies won't appear in Norwegian databases
- Focus on Phase 1 (positive verification) MORE than Norwegian fraud databases
- Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and official websites are PRIMARY sources
- Only check Norwegian databases if company claims to be Norwegian

**Example searches for international domains:**
- "[company name] Wikipedia" ‚Üê Start here!
- "[company name] official site"
- "[company name] [country] company"
- "[domain] about company"
- Then: "[domain] scam reviews" (not Norwegian-specific searches)

## üìù VERIFICATION DETAILS REQUIREMENTS üìù

For each URL in urlVerifications array, include SPECIFIC details:

**For "legitimate":**
\`\`\`
verificationDetails: "Established [industry] company since [year], verified via [sources]. [Key facts: Wikipedia/business registry/social media presence]"
\`\`\`
Examples:
- "Established Norwegian fashion brand since 2012, verified via Wikipedia and official website. Sold in 180+ stores internationally, featured in Vogue."
- "Swedish customer experience platform for retail, used by 400+ brands. Verified via Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and official site voyado.com."

**For "unknown":**
\`\`\`
verificationDetails: "Insufficient information available. No Wikipedia page, no business registry entry, no clear company information found. Domain appears to be [new/obscure/minimal presence]."
\`\`\`

**For "verified_scam":**
\`\`\`
verificationDetails: "WARNING: [Specific fraud evidence found]. Reported on [source]. [Details of scam pattern]."
\`\`\`
Example:
- "WARNING: Fake fashion store. Multiple scam reports on forbrukertilsynet.no. Claims Norwegian but ships from China. No legitimate business registration."

## üéØ SEARCH PRIORITY GUIDELINES üéØ

1. **Start positive, then negative**: Always search for legitimacy BEFORE fraud
2. **Context matters**: International domains need international verification sources
3. **Multiple sources**: Require 2+ positive indicators for "legitimate" status
4. **Be specific**: Include founding year, industry, key facts in verificationDetails
5. **Don't assume**: "No fraud reports in Norwegian databases" ‚â† "unknown" for international domains

## FOR PHONE NUMBERS (Norwegian +47 format):
- Search: "[phone number] site:telefonterror.co.no"
- Search: "[phone number] site:1881.no"
- Search: "[phone number] svindel OR bedrageri"
- Search: "site:politiet.no [phone number]"

## FOR GENERAL FRAUD PATTERNS:
- Search: "[suspicious text] site:politiet.no svindel"
- Search: "[pattern] site:nettvett.no phishing"
- Search: "2025 svindel [keyword]"

Remember: The goal is ACCURATE classification, not defaulting to "unknown" when information exists!
