# DNB Svindelsjekk - Easter Egg Functionality Test Report

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of the DNB Svindelsjekk application's Easter egg functionality to verify two specific issues:
1. Save/cancel buttons appearance when changing model selection
2. First fraud check being done locally without API calls

## Test Environment
- **Application URL**: http://localhost:3001
- **Browser**: Chromium (Playwright)
- **Date**: September 12, 2025
- **Test Framework**: Custom Playwright test scripts

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Easter Egg Activation by "RaiRai"**
   - Typing "RaiRai" (case-insensitive) successfully activates the Easter egg
   - Model selector dropdown appears as expected
   - Screenshots: `2-after-rairai-typed.png`, `3-model-selector-visible.png`

2. **Model Selector Visibility**
   - DNB Dropdown component renders correctly
   - 9 AI model options are available:
     - GPT-4o Mini (Fast)
     - GPT-5 (Latest)
     - GPT-4o (Balanced)
     - Claude 4 Opus (Best)
     - Claude 4 Sonnet
     - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
     - Gemini 2.5 Pro
     - Gemini 2.5 Flash (Fast)
     - Llama 3.2 (Free)
   - Screenshot: `dom-inspection-after-selection.png`

3. **Local Pattern Analysis**
   - Pattern-based fraud detection works correctly
   - Instant analysis without API delays
   - Comprehensive pattern matching with 84+ fraud detection patterns

### ❌ Confirmed Issues

#### Issue 1: Save/Cancel Buttons Not Appearing
**Status**: CONFIRMED BUG

**Description**: Save and Cancel buttons do not appear when changing the model selection in the dropdown.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- When user changes model selection, `pendingModel` state should be set
- Save and Cancel buttons should become visible
- User can then save or cancel the model change

**Actual Behavior**:
- Model dropdown can be opened and shows all options
- Clicking on different options does not trigger save/cancel buttons to appear
- No visual feedback that model selection has changed

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The issue appears to be in the `handleModelChange` function in `/src/app/page.tsx`. The DNB Dropdown component's `on_change` event may not be triggering correctly, preventing the `pendingModel` state from being set.

**Code Location**:
```typescript
// In /src/app/page.tsx lines 219-225
const handleModelChange = (e: any) => {
  const model = typeof e === 'string' ? e : (e?.value || e?.data?.value || selectedModel);
  if (typeof model === 'string') {
    setPendingModel(model);
  }
};
```

**Technical Details**:
- React component state inspection shows React Fiber is present (`__reactFiber$` and `__reactProps$`)
- DNB Dropdown has proper event handlers but they don't seem to trigger the onChange callback
- Keyboard navigation also fails to trigger the state change

#### Issue 2: API Calls Made Even Without Easter Egg
**Status**: UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR FOUND

**Description**: The application makes API calls even when the Easter egg is not activated.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- First check should use only local pattern matching
- API calls should only happen when model selector is visible (Easter egg active)

**Actual Behavior**:
- API calls to `/api/analyze-advanced` are made regardless of Easter egg status
- Local pattern analysis still works, but API calls are also triggered

**API Call Evidence**:
```
API calls made during local check: 1
API calls: [
  {
    url: 'http://localhost:3001/api/analyze-advanced',
    method: 'POST',
    timestamp: 1757678410236
  }
]
```

**Code Analysis**:
The issue is in the `handleCheck` function in `/src/app/page.tsx` lines 173-174:
```typescript
// This condition may be triggering incorrectly
if (useAI || showModelSelector) {
```

## Test Evidence

### Screenshots Captured
1. `1-initial-state.png` - Application initial state
2. `2-after-rairai-typed.png` - After typing "RaiRai"
3. `3-model-selector-visible.png` - Model selector visible
4. `save-cancel-2-easter-egg-activated.png` - Easter egg activated
5. `save-cancel-3-dropdown-opened.png` - Dropdown opened showing options
6. `save-cancel-5-FAILED-buttons-missing.png` - Confirms missing save/cancel buttons
7. `state-test-after-keyboard-change.png` - After keyboard navigation attempt

### Network Request Analysis
- **Local Analysis**: Should make 0 API calls ❌ (Actually makes 1)
- **Easter Egg Analysis**: Should make 1+ API calls ✅ (Makes 1)
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/analyze-advanced` 
- **Request Format**: POST with `{text: string, model: string}`

### Console Errors
- No critical JavaScript errors found
- No React warnings or errors during testing

## Recommendations

### Fix 1: Save/Cancel Buttons Issue
**Priority**: High

Update the DNB Dropdown event handling:

```typescript
// Ensure the on_change event is properly structured for DNB Dropdown
on_change={({ data }) => handleModelChange(data?.selected_key || data?.value)}
```

Or investigate if the DNB Dropdown component requires a different event structure.

### Fix 2: Unwanted API Calls
**Priority**: Medium

Modify the API call condition to be more explicit:

```typescript
// Only call API when Easter egg is explicitly active
if ((useAI || showModelSelector) && showModelSelector) {
  // API call logic
}
```

### Additional Improvements
1. Add visual feedback when model selection changes (even without save/cancel buttons)
2. Add loading state for model selection
3. Consider adding debug logging for state changes in development mode

## Test Scripts Created

1. **easter-egg-functionality.spec.ts** - Comprehensive Playwright test suite
2. **api-call-monitoring.spec.ts** - Network request monitoring tests  
3. **test-easter-egg.js** - Quick functional test script
4. **test-save-cancel-buttons.js** - Focused save/cancel button testing
5. **test-dom-inspection.js** - DOM structure analysis
6. **test-application-state.js** - React state and component testing

## Conclusion

The Easter egg functionality is partially working:
- ✅ Easter egg activation works correctly
- ✅ Model selector appears as expected
- ✅ Local fraud analysis works properly
- ❌ Save/Cancel buttons do not appear (CONFIRMED BUG)
- ❌ API calls are made even without Easter egg active (NEEDS FIX)

Both reported issues have been confirmed and provide clear paths for resolution. The primary issue is with the DNB Dropdown component's event handling not triggering the React state updates correctly.
